    ">In this lab, I worked with a data set surrounding the democrats involved in the primary elections this year around our country. Throughout the lab, I worked to answer a few questions. How many candidates were running for governor? What about the U.S. House of Representatives? How many identified as LGBTQ, non-white, or were veterans? How many were Obama Alum? How many of these democratic candidates advanced to the general election? How many lost their races?"

    "My data is all from FiveThirtyEight: a well known, reputable website founded by Nate Silver that focuses on data analysis, specifically poll analysis. The data set contains information from all open democratic primary elections through August 7th of 2018. The data set contains information on the 811 democratic candidates who ran for various positions up until the 7th. The specific data set I used contained 812 lines of data, and was extremely well organized. One downside of the data-set was that some information surrounding party support, Emily endorsed, gun sense, Biden endorsed, and more were missing or partially filled out. The table was not fully complete. However, the data was well organized, accurate, and the GitHub description contained information on where each number, fact, or name was pulled from."

    ">Overall, I learned alot from the data set and analysis at hand. Out of the 811 democratic candidates that this data set covered, around 12% of them ran for governor, while around 84% ran for U.S. House of Representatives. 4.6% of candidates are LGBTQ, and 25% of them do not identify as white. About 15% of candidates who ran are veterans. The majority of candidates lost their race, but the winning democrat moves onto the general election- as the 265 advancing are the democratic candidate in the general. A large amount of democratic candidates ran for office this year, as more candidates lost than one (as they were racing against eachother). This should mean a good turnout of voters and support for the general, as the democratic winner was narrowed against a tougher competition with more candidates. This large show of democratic candidates suggests a strong support for democrats in November, but could also lead to a split vote as more candidates ran and a greater variety were supported. In addition, this year a fair amount of LGBTQ, non-white, and veterans ran for office, making for a more diverse and different group of candidates. "

    "Through my new knowledge of data cleaning and pandas, I was able to gather additional information surrounding my data set. Out of the 811 democratic candidates, 100 ran for governor, 687 ran for U.S. House of Reps, and 24 ran for senator positions. 265 candidates advanced, while 546 did not. My data set covers primaries from a total of 37 states. Of these 37 states, the most candidates ran in Texas, as they has a total of 109 candidates who ran. The second highest was California, with 68 candidates. Out of the entire data set, the district in which the most candidates ran in the country was for governor of california, with 12 candidates for this position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, through pandas, I was able to gather more specific data in a wider range. In the future, I would love to explore methods beyond count to work with when using string values. If I had more time, I would also have loved to find a way to convert my strings to integers per column and then be able to analyze that with pandas methods such as describe and info. Again, the large number of democratic candidates who ran should mean a good turnout of voters as the primary elections were more competitive. However, again, this could also lead to a split vote as a greater pool of candidates ran in the primary. Additionally, I was surprised to find that there were 24 democratic candidates who ran for senator seats. Those senate races will be interesting ones to watch. Because there is a smaller pool of candidates for these races, and senate seats are more competitive, the outcomes of the senate races could be super important. Finally, the governor of California was the most competitive primary democratic race included in this set of data, with 12 candidates running for one position. This should be interesting to watch. Because there were 12 candidates to choose from, this may mean more democratic support in the general as their candidates all had tough competition. However, this could again just mean a more split vote as less people's vote were represented over the 12 candidates. "
